These form inputs are client validated so the use will get instant feedback, very popular for todays form. Also, they have special consideration for accessibility baked in!\r\n\r\nAccessibility\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nOne of the goals for this project is to make the forms accessible out of the box with no additional development required. This is done by careful design of the forms and use of the ngAria library.\r\n\r\n* Color blind visuals on inputs\r\n* Proper labeling for screen readers\r\n* On form validation labeling\r\n\r\n*Now I am not an expert in accessibility, so I made have missed something, please let me know.*\r\n\r\nForm Input Included\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n_Note: The form elements are US validated_\r\n* Text\r\n* Text-area\r\n* Number\r\n* Percentage\r\n* Email\r\n* Password\r\n* Website / URL\r\n* Phone number\r\n* State\r\n* Zip Code\r\n* Radio Buttons Groups\r\n* Check-box Groups\r\n* Date picker ( UI.Bootstrap required)\r\n* Confirm Dialogue ( UI.Bootstrap required)\r\n* Picture Preview & Uploader\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n* Check out the examples folder for a basic example for each form component\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n* This depends on AngularJS, ngAria, ngMessages, Bootstrap, & UI.Bootstrap, Please include these first\r\n* Include the compiled file\r\n      <script src=\"path/practicalforms.js\"></script>\r\n* Add the module as a dependence of the angular app\r\n      angular.modular(\"app\", ['jjp.practical-forms']);\r\n* Add the directive to the form\r\n      <pf-email ng-model=\"data.email\"></pf-email>\r\n_See the example folder for a nice list of all components and options_\r\n\r\nCustom Builds\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nCustom builds are not configured, but totally possible with grunt. Each form component is independent, the only require file in the `src/practical-forms.js` file. Grunt just concats all of the files together, so if you clone the repo and remove a component folder, it is gone. Custom build done!\r\n\r\n_You could use this method to easily remove the dependency on ui.boostrap_\r\n\r\nIssues\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n* If you have issues, please report them. I will be more encourage to develop this further if there is activity.\r\n* Tested 1.2 & 1.3 version of angular.js. If there are errors with early/later version, submit an issues or patch.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense & Contributing\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n* This code is distributed under the MIT License.
